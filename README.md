Course Code: ETCCDS202  

# 📌 Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Data Structures lab curriculum for the 2026 session. While the manual includes faculty-led experiments, this section focuses on the completed Unit 1 Assignment tasks.

# 📂 Unit 1 Assignment: Foundations & Algorithmic Analysis
The following tasks were implemented independently to demonstrate foundational DS concepts: 
- **Recursive Factorial & Fibonacci:** Implementations of both naive and memoized versions to compare efficiency.
- **Performance Analysis:** Detailed time and space complexity justifications, specifically addressing why naive Fibonacci is inefficient ($O(2^n)$). 
- **Tower of Hanoi:** Recursive solution including a manual state trace for $N=3$ and derivation of time complexity. 
- **Recursive Binary Search:** Implementation with a complexity explanation based on the recurrence intuition $T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1)$. 

# 🛠️ Requirements
- Language: Python
- Environment: Terminal/CLI for execution
